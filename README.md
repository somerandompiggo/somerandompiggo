# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the README of ME

I am a mediocre programmer from England who enjoys writing in C and Go but I write in other languages depending on the usecase. My main interests are graphics programming, video compression, optimization, the demoscene and operating systems. Sometimes I do frontend web development but only when I really have to!

I only use Linux because it's the most well supported UNIX-like OS you can run on modern computers. Other than that, I really don't like it. Windows does UX right, but without WSL it's useless for anything other than gaming or other media consumption unless you want to deal with Visual Studio.
